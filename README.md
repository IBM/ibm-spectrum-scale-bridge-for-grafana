The ***IBM Storage Scale bridge for Grafana*** could be used for exploring IBM Storage Scale performance data on [Grafana dashboards](https://grafana.com/grafana/).

Grafana Bridge is a standalone Python application. It translates the IBM Storage Scale metadata and performance data collected by the [IBM Storage Scale performance monitoring tool (ZiMon)](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/storage-scale/5.1.8?topic=monitoring-using-performance-tool) to the query requests acceptable by the [Grafana integrated openTSDB plugin](https://grafana.com/docs/features/datasources/opentsdb/).
